# 137. Nextjs auth full stack

It looks like you're outlining a tutorial about building a real-world production-grade Next.js application with TypeScript, using a MongoDB backend and various other tools for things like authentication, email services, and the overall app architecture. You're also emphasizing that this tutorial is designed not just to teach Next.js but to give learners the confidence to build scalable, production-ready applications.

### Here's a quick summary of what you've covered so far:

1. **Tech Stack & Prerequisites:**
   - **Next.js** (modern app directory structure)
   - **TypeScript** (but JavaScript knowledge is enough)
   - **React.js** basics (useState, useEffect)
   - **MongoDB** (for the backend/database)
   - **Email Services** (Mailtrap for emails)
   - **Authentication** (Signup, login, user profile, password reset, account verification)

2. **App Overview:**
   - You're building a simple user authentication system.
   - This includes **Signup**, **Login**, and **Profile** functionality, with advanced features like password reset and email verification.
   - Focus on **backend (API)** and **frontend (pages)** separation within the `app` directory.
   
3. **Directory Structure:**
   - You explained the importance of the `app` directory, its separation into **frontend** and **backend** components.
   - The backend logic (e.g., API routes) goes into a folder named `api`, while the frontend (UI) goes into `pages` or `components`.
   
4. **MongoDB Setup:**
   - You've walked through setting up MongoDB in the cloud (using MongoDB Atlas).
   - Creating a **cluster**, adding **users**, and setting up **IP access** are explained.
   - You'll later connect your Next.js app to MongoDB for backend operations like authentication.

### Next Steps:
It looks like you'll be diving deeper into the Next.js `app` directory, middleware usage, and connecting to MongoDB. If you need any specific help or further breakdown on certain parts like MongoDB setup, Next.js routing, or TypeScript usage, feel free to ask! This project has a lot of moving parts, and I can guide you through any stage.

**Summary:**

The tutorial guides you through setting up a **Next.js project** with authentication features, including creating the necessary folder structure, installing dependencies, and setting up configurations.

### Key Steps Covered:

1. **Setup Next.js Application:**
   - Open a new folder, create a new Next.js app using `NPX create-next-app`.
   - Answer prompts regarding TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind, source directory, and app router.
   - Discusses the importance of using the `source` directory and `app router` for routing.

2. **Directory Structure:**
   - Shows how to create a simple app with a `login` and `signup` page inside the `app` directory.
   - Explains that in Next.js, routes are based on folder names and that each page requires a `page.tsx` file inside its respective folder.

3. **Installing Dependencies:**
   - Install packages like:
     - `axios` for HTTP requests.
     - `bcryptjs` for password encryption.
     - `jsonwebtoken` for generating secure tokens.
     - `nodemailer` for sending emails.
     - `mongoose` for database communication with MongoDB.
   - Mentions `react-hot-toast` for pop-up messages (optional).

4. **Environment Variables:**
   - Emphasizes securing environment variables like database URLs and secret keys using `.env` files.
   - Provides a demonstration of setting environment variables for MongoDB connection, token secrets, and the local domain.

5. **Folder Structure for API Routes:**
   - Introduces the idea of handling API routes under an `API` folder inside the `app` directory.
   - A `signup` API route is created under `API/users/signup.ts` for handling the backend part of the login/registration functionality.

6. **Database Configuration:**
   - A database connection configuration file (`dbConfig.ts`) will be used for connecting to the MongoDB database.

The tutorial emphasizes **Next.js’ server-side rendering** approach, **modular structure**, and the **importance of secure practices** for password storage and token management. Additionally, the **routing structure** relies on folder and file naming conventions in Next.js, which is essential for the framework’s behavior.

This guide outlines the initial steps and folder setup to build an authenticated app with user sign-in capabilities in Next.js. It also prepares you for the next steps, such as connecting to the MongoDB database and handling user authentication securely.

It seems like you're working on integrating a MongoDB connection in a Next.js app, along with setting up a simple signup screen for user registration. You’re also explaining some important concepts, like handling backend and frontend components in Next.js, particularly the `use client` decorator for making frontend components. Here's a summary of your main points so far:

### MongoDB Connection Setup in Next.js (Backend)
1. **Mongoose Connection**:
   - You use `mongoose.connect()` with a URI from environment variables (`process.env.MONGO_URI`).
   - To ensure TypeScript doesn't complain about the possibility of `MONGO_URI` being undefined, you use `!` (non-null assertion) to assure the compiler that the URI will always be available.
   
2. **Event Listeners**:
   - You listen for the `connected` event to confirm that the connection to MongoDB was successful.
   - Similarly, you handle the `error` event to log errors if the connection fails, with appropriate messages like "MongoDB connection error."

3. **MongoDB Connection in API**:
   - It’s crucial to call `mongoose.connect()` whenever you're making any API calls to interact with the database. There is no exception to this, as every interaction with MongoDB needs an active connection.

### Frontend Setup for Signup Form
1. **Client-Side Components**:
   - In the latest versions of Next.js, most components default to server-side rendering. However, for interactive elements like a signup form, you need to explicitly mark them as client components.
   - You do this by adding `"use client"` at the top of your component file. This tells Next.js that the component should be rendered on the client side, which allows you to use hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.

2. **Libraries for the Frontend**:
   - You’re likely using libraries such as React for the UI and `next/link` for routing.

3. **Signup Form**:
   - You want the frontend to gather data (like user credentials) and send it to the backend. This is typically done with an `axios` or `fetch` request. Since it's a client-side component, you will need to make sure that the necessary actions are executed within the frontend environment.

You’re headed in a solid direction, and as you move forward with handling the actual API calls and form submission logic, you’ll likely set up things like form validation, error handling, and potentially a loading state to improve the user experience.

In this video, the focus is on building a signup and login page with Next.js. Here’s a breakdown of the steps covered:

1. **Using `useRouter` in Next.js**:
   - The router import is different in Next.js (coming from `next/navigation`), which is a common mistake to avoid. The correct import is `useRouter` from `next/navigation`.

2. **Setting Up Axios**:
   - Axios is used for API requests, and you need to install the types for it manually in TypeScript. Suggestions from IDEs might be misleading at times.

3. **User Data**:
   - A `useState` hook is used to manage user input like username, email, and password. A method, `onSignup`, is defined to handle the signup logic (which will later connect to the backend).

4. **Creating the Signup Form**:
   - A simple signup form is built with labels and input fields for username, email, and password.
   - The form includes a submit button that triggers the `onSignup` method when clicked.

5. **Setting Up the Login Page**:
   - A similar approach is used for the login page, where only the email and password are required.
   - The login page includes a button that calls an `onLogin` method to handle login logic.

6. **Profile Page**:
   - A basic profile page is created with a dynamic route to capture a user’s ID from the URL. This involves creating a dynamic folder inside the `pages` directory, using square brackets (`[id]`), and creating a page to handle the display of that user’s profile.
   - This dynamic routing is a key feature in Next.js, allowing for easy capture of URL parameters.

7. **Moving Forward**:
   - In the next steps, the goal is to start building the backend APIs (e.g., for signup, login) and connect them to the frontend.

The video covers how to create a functional and simple signup/login flow and touches on the basics of working with dynamic routes in Next.js, which sets the foundation for building full-stack applications.

In nextjs everything is server component
and  server component dont have access to anything that is on the frontend side its on server


the location, the URL, anything that's on the page
that's on the client side and you have to
explicitly make your application as a client side.


Here's a simple hint.
Most of the things in the API folder, yep, that's
on the back end side, that's default server component.


But anything that's usually outside, not always,
but outside is usually a client component.


We can go ahead and say use client.
That is it one decorator and
it is now a client component.

### How I can design API 
 Building an API : signup API 

## 138. Signup and login

### Summary in Points:

1. **Introduction**:
   - The video is part of a complete full-stack course.
   - This is part two of the series, so it’s recommended to watch part one first.

2. **Frontend Recap**:
   - In the previous part, the frontend file structure was discussed.
   - The connection to the backend wasn't covered yet.

3. **Backend Focus**:
   - In this section, the focus shifts to creating **models** that can interact with the database.
   - The database has already been set up and environment variables injected.

4. **Database Connection**:
   - A database connection file is necessary, which should be called in every API call to maintain the connection.
   - The backend needs to ensure that edge functions, which don’t have a persistent database connection, are handled properly.

5. **Model Creation**:
   - A simple model will be created to define the structure of the database.

Different approaches to model design will be discussed.
API Development:

After creating the model, the next step is building a signup feature with APIs/controllers.
The goal is to handle data from the frontend and send it to the database.
Next Steps:

The video will continue with building out the signup functionality, with further steps planned after that.


Here are the summarized points from the explanation:

1. **Mongoose Setup:**
   - First, import `mongoose` and set up the schema for a `User`.
   - The user schema contains fields like `username`, `email`, and `password`. Additionally, custom fields like `isVerified` and `isAdmin` are included.

2. **Export Model:**
   - Export the Mongoose model, ensuring that it handles cases where the model might already exist in the database.
   - Use `mongoose.models` to check if the model is already defined; if not, create a new model.

3. **Fields in User Schema:**
   - `username`, `email`, and `password` are required fields, with custom messages and unique constraints.
   - Additional fields like `isVerified` and `isAdmin` are used for user roles and verification status.

4. **Tokens Handling:**
   - Tokens like `forgotPasswordToken`, `forgotPasswordTokenExpiry`, and `verifyToken` are included in the schema for password recovery and user verification.
   - Tokens are typically strings, and they are encrypted using `bcryptjs`.

5. **Database Operations:**
   - Tokens are generated by the API and saved in the database and sent to the user.
   - The verification and password reset process involves matching the token in the database and updating the user’s status or password accordingly.

6. **API Structure in Next.js:**
   - The API should handle different HTTP request methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) in a standardized way.
   - Define functions for handling requests in the appropriate manner (e.g., creating a user, updating a user, etc.).

7. **Handling User Signup:**
   - For user signup, the data is handled via POST requests.
   - Mongoose model is used to create and save new users.
   - Passwords are encrypted using `bcryptjs` before saving to the database.

8. **Connection to the Database:**
   - A `dbConfig` function is imported to connect to the database using Mongoose.
   - Ensure the correct database model is imported and used for operations.

9. **Error Handling and Response:**
   - Use `try-catch` blocks for error handling.
   - Return a `JSON` response with an error message and status code.

10. **Request Body Parsing:**
   - Use `await request.json()` to parse the request body and extract necessary data.

This covers the basics of setting up a Mongoose model, handling tokens, and creating standardized API routes in a Next.js application.

In this tutorial, we walk through the process of building a user sign-up functionality using Express and React with Next.js, focusing on validation, hashing passwords, and handling the UI/UX.

1. **Back-End Setup:**
   - **Request Handling:** We start by processing the incoming request from the frontend, which contains the user's `username`, `email`, and `password`.
   - **Validation:** Basic validation checks are implemented, such as verifying that the email, username, and password exist in the request body. We also ensure that the email is not already registered by querying the database with Mongoose’s `findOne` method.
   - **Password Hashing:** The password is hashed using the `bcryptjs` library. The `saltRounds` (default 10 rounds) define the complexity of the hash.
   - **User Creation:** Once validated and hashed, we create a new user in the database and save it. The response will return the user’s details along with a success message.

2. **Front-End Setup (React & Next.js):**
   - **State Management:** We create various states to handle form data, form submission status (`loading`, `button disabled`), and the request process.
   - **UI Update:** A `useEffect` hook is utilized to monitor the changes in the input fields and enable/disable the sign-up button accordingly. If all fields have values, the button is enabled; otherwise, it remains disabled.
   - **Conditional Button Text:** The button text changes based on the loading state, showing "Processing" during the submission and "Sign Up" otherwise.
   - **Axios Integration:** Axios is used to handle the form submission to the back-end, with proper error handling via `try-catch` blocks.
   - **Loading Indicator:** We added a basic loading state to display a processing message while the request is being made to the server.

3. **Error Handling and Response:** Both on the back-end and front-end, appropriate error messages are returned in case of missing or invalid data. On the back-end, if the user already exists, a message is returned. On the front-end, form validation is managed dynamically.

The overall goal is to create a seamless user registration process, integrating proper backend validation, password hashing, and frontend form handling. This process can be expanded to include more advanced validation and error handling as needed.

The provided text is a detailed walkthrough of implementing user authentication features, specifically signup and login, in a web application using Next.js, React, and MongoDB. Here's a summary of the key points:

### **Signup Implementation**
1. **Frontend Setup**:
   - The signup form collects user details (username, email, password).
   - The form uses React state to manage loading and button disabled states.
   - Axios is used to send a POST request to the backend API (`/api/users/signup`) with user data.

2. **Backend Setup**:
   - The backend API route (`/api/users/signup`) handles the request.
   - It connects to the MongoDB database and checks if the user already exists.
   - If the user doesn't exist, it hashes the password using `bcrypt` and saves the user to the database.
   - A success response is sent back to the frontend, and the user is redirected to the login page.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Errors (e.g., duplicate email) are caught and displayed using `react-hot-toast` for user feedback.
   - Console logs are used for debugging on both the frontend and backend.

4. **Database Interaction**:
   - The user data is stored in MongoDB, with fields like `email`, `password`, `isVerified`, and `isAdmin`.

---

### **Login Implementation**
1. **Frontend Setup**:
   - The login form collects email and password.
   - Similar to the signup form, it uses React state for loading and button disabled states.
   - Axios sends a POST request to the backend API (`/api/users/login`) with the login credentials.

2. **Backend Setup**:
   - The backend API route (`/api/users/login`) handles the request.
   - It checks if the user exists in the database and verifies the password using `bcrypt.compare`.
   - If the credentials are valid, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is created and set in the user's cookies.
   - The token contains user data (e.g., `id`, `email`) and has an expiration time (e.g., 1 day).

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Errors (e.g., invalid email or password) are caught and displayed using `react-hot-toast`.
   - Console logs are used for debugging.

4. **Redirection**:
   - On successful login, the user is redirected to the profile page.

---

### **Challenges and Next Steps**
1. **No Logout Mechanism**:
   - The application currently lacks a logout feature to clear the user's token and session.

2. **Route Protection**:
   - There is no mechanism to prevent unauthenticated users from accessing protected routes (e.g., profile page) or authenticated users from accessing login/signup pages.

3. **Middleware for Authentication**:
   - Middleware needs to be implemented to verify the JWT token and protect routes based on user authentication status.

4. **Debugging and Real-World Development**:
   - The process highlighted the importance of debugging, saving files, and restarting the server during development.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- The implementation demonstrates a full-stack authentication flow:
  - **Frontend**: Forms, state management, and API calls.
  - **Backend**: Database interaction, password hashing, JWT creation, and cookie management.
- Debugging is a critical part of development, and small oversights (e.g., unsaved files) can cause issues.
- The next steps involve adding logout functionality, route protection, and middleware for a complete authentication system.
